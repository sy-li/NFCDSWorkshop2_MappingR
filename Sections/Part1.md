### What is Cartography

**Cartography** is the art and science of graphically representing a geographical area, usually on a flat surface such as a map or chart. It may involve the superimposition of political, cultural, or other nongeographical divisions onto the representation of a geographical area (_[Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/cartography)_).

In short, cartography is the study of making and using maps.


### Map Types

One common categorization in the field of cartography is **general maps** vs **thematic maps**.

General maps contain a variety of features, oriented toward general audience.

Thematic maps involve specific geographic themes, targeted to specific audiences.


### Principles of Map Design

The central goal of cartography is to communicate spatial information effectively. It combines science, aesthetics and technique.
